PADDING:
you should always try to use the exists padding variables 
from padding resources or create new padding variables if needed.
ie : screen side padding.


LANGUAGE:
you should always try to use the exists texts system 

by adding key & values to files : 
///[assets/langs/ar.json]
///[lib/core/services/localization/localization_keys.dart]

and using them like : 
sl<LocalizationManager>().get(LocalizationKeys.home.title)
