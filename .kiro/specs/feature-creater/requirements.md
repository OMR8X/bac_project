# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides an automated BLoC pattern implementation system for Flutter applications. The system creates the complete folder structure and generates all necessary BLoC files (events, states, bloc class, and view) following established architectural patterns and coding standards. This streamlines the development process by ensuring consistent BLoC implementation across the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want an automated system to create BLoC folder structures, so that I can maintain consistent architecture across my application without manual setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a feature directory is provided THEN the system SHALL verify the directory exists and is accessible
2. WHEN creating folder structure THEN the system SHALL create `blocs/` folder if it doesn't exist
3. WHEN creating folder structure THEN the system SHALL create `blocs/[bloc_name]_bloc/` subfolder
4. WHEN creating folder structure THEN the system SHALL create `views/` folder if it doesn't exist

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want all BLoC files to be automatically generated with proper naming conventions, so that my code follows consistent patterns and is easily maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating BLoC files THEN the system SHALL create `[bloc_name]_event.dart` file in the bloc subfolder
2. WHEN generating BLoC files THEN the system SHALL create `[bloc_name]_state.dart` file in the bloc subfolder
3. WHEN generating BLoC files THEN the system SHALL create `[bloc_name]_bloc.dart` file in the bloc subfolder
4. WHEN generating BLoC files THEN the system SHALL create `[bloc_name]_view.dart` file in the views folder
5. WHEN naming files THEN the system SHALL replace `[bloc_name]` placeholder with the actual bloc name provided

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want each generated BLoC file to follow established coding rules and patterns, so that the code is consistent with project standards and best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing event file THEN the system SHALL follow rules defined in `.kiro/rules/bloc/create_bloc_event_rules.md`
2. WHEN implementing state file THEN the system SHALL follow rules defined in `.kiro/rules/bloc/create_bloc_state_rules.md`
3. WHEN implementing BLoC class THEN the system SHALL follow rules defined in `.kiro/rules/bloc/create_bloc_class_rules.md`
4. WHEN implementing view file THEN the system SHALL follow rules defined in `.kiro/rules/bloc/create_bloc_view_rules.md`

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want the BLoC generation process to be executed step-by-step in a specific order, so that dependencies are properly established and the implementation is reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting BLoC generation THEN the system SHALL first verify the feature directory
2. WHEN directory is verified THEN the system SHALL create the folder structure before generating files
3. WHEN folders are created THEN the system SHALL implement files in this order: event file, state file, BLoC class, then view file
4. WHEN each step completes THEN the system SHALL proceed to the next step automatically
5. IF any step fails THEN the system SHALL halt execution and report the error
