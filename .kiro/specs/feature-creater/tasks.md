  - Create unit tests for directory validation and folder creation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 3. Implement Rule Engine component
  - Write loadRules function to read and parse rule files from .kiro/rules/bloc/ directory
  - Implement applyRules function to process templates with rule-based transformations
  - Create rule validation logic to ensure rule files are properly formatted
  - Write unit tests for rule loading and application
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 4. Implement File Generator component
- [ ] 4.1 Create event file generation
  - Write generateEventFile function that creates [bloc_name]_event.dart in bloc subfolder
  - Apply event rules from .kiro/rules/bloc/create_bloc_event_rules.md
  - Include configurable BLoC description in generated file comments
  - Write unit tests for event file generation
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.5, 3.1_

- [ ] 4.2 Create state file generation
  - Write generateStateFile function that creates [bloc_name]_state.dart in bloc subfolder
  - Apply state rules from .kiro/rules/bloc/create_bloc_state_rules.md
  - Include configurable BLoC description in generated file comments
  - Write unit tests for state file generation
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.5, 3.2_

- [ ] 4.3 Create BLoC class generation
  - Write generateBlocFile function that creates [bloc_name]_bloc.dart in bloc subfolder
  - Apply BLoC class rules from .kiro/rules/bloc/create_bloc_class_rules.md
  - Include configurable BLoC description in generated file comments
  - Write unit tests for BLoC class generation
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.5, 3.3_

- [ ] 4.4 Create view file generation
  - Write generateViewFile function that creates [bloc_name]_view.dart in views folder
  - Apply view rules from .kiro/rules/bloc/create_bloc_view_rules.md
  - Include configurable BLoC description in generated file comments
  - Write unit tests for view file generation
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 2.5, 3.4_

- [ ] 5. Implement Workflow Orchestrator component
  - Write execute function that manages sequential execution of generation steps
  - Implement step-by-step workflow: validate directory, create folders, generate files in order
  - Create handleError function with fail-fast error handling and detailed logging
  - Implement rollback capability to clean up partially created files on failure
  - Write integration tests for complete workflow execution
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 6. Create main BLoC generation interface
  - Implement main function that accepts featurePath, blocName, and blocDescription parameters
  - Wire together all components (Directory Manager, File Generator, Rule Engine, Workflow Orchestrator)
  - Add input validation for required parameters
  - Create end-to-end tests with real Flutter project structure
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.5, 4.1_

- [ ] 7. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Implement detailed error messages for each failure scenario
  - Add logging for each generation step for debugging purposes
  - Create error recovery mechanisms where possible
  - Write tests for error conditions and edge cases
  - _Requirements: 4.5_
