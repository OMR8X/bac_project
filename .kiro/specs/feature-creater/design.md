# Design Document

## Overview

The BLoC Pattern Implementation System is designed as an automated code generation tool that creates consistent Flutter BLoC architecture components. The system follows a sequential workflow to ensure proper dependency establishment and maintains architectural consistency across the Flutter application.

## Posts BLoC Functionality

The Posts BLoC manages the complete posts lifecycle within the Flutter application. This BLoC handles post creation, retrieval, updating, deletion, and post state management for social media or blog functionality.

### Core Responsibilities

**Post State Management**:
- Tracks current posts loading status (loading, loaded, error)
- Maintains list of posts with pagination support
- Handles individual post details and metadata

**Post Operations**:
- Fetch posts from API with pagination
- Create new posts with text, images, and metadata
- Update existing posts (edit content, status)
- Delete posts with confirmation
- Like/unlike posts and manage engagement

**Content Features**:
- Support for rich text content and media attachments
- Draft post management and auto-save functionality
- Post categorization and tagging system
- Search and filter posts by various criteria

### Posts Events

- `PostsFetchRequested`: Triggered to load posts from API
- `PostCreateRequested`: Triggered when user creates a new post
- `PostUpdateRequested`: Triggered when user edits an existing post
- `PostDeleteRequested`: Triggered when user deletes a post
- `PostLikeToggled`: Triggered when user likes/unlikes a post
- `PostsRefreshRequested`: Triggered to refresh the posts list

### Posts States

- `PostsInitial`: Initial state before any posts are loaded
- `PostsLoading`: Loading posts from API or processing operations
- `PostsLoaded`: Posts successfully loaded with data
- `PostsError`: Error occurred while loading or processing posts
- `PostOperationSuccess`: Successful post creation, update, or deletion

### Integration Points

- **API Service**: Communicates with backend posts endpoints
- **Local Storage**: Caches posts for offline viewing
- **Media Service**: Handles image/video uploads for posts
- **Navigation**: Manages routing to post details and creation screens

## Architecture

The system follows a command-driven architecture with the following key components:

- **Directory Manager**: Handles folder structure creation and validation
- **File Generator**: Creates BLoC files based on predefined templates and rules
- **Rule Engine**: Applies coding standards from rule files
- **Workflow Orchestrator**: Manages the sequential execution of generation steps

## Components and Interfaces

### Directory Manager
- **Purpose**: Validates feature directories and creates required folder structure
- **Key Methods**:
  - `validateFeatureDirectory(path: string): boolean`
  - `createBlocFolders(featurePath: string, blocName: string): void`
  - `createViewsFolder(featurePath: string): void`

### File Generator
- **Purpose**: Generates BLoC files with proper naming conventions
- **Key Methods**:
  - `generateEventFile(blocName: string, outputPath: string): void`
  - `generateStateFile(blocName: string, outputPath: string): void`
  - `generateBlocFile(blocName: string, outputPath: string): void`
  - `generateViewFile(blocName: string, outputPath: string): void`

### Rule Engine
- **Purpose**: Applies coding standards from rule files
- **Key Methods**:
  - `loadRules(ruleFilePath: string): RuleSet`
  - `applyRules(template: string, rules: RuleSet): string`

### Workflow Orchestrator
- **Purpose**: Manages sequential execution and error handling
- **Key Methods**:
  - `execute(featurePath: string, blocName: string): void`
  - `handleError(step: string, error: Error): void`

## Data Models

### BlocGenerationConfig
```typescript
interface BlocGenerationConfig {
  featurePath: string;
  blocName: string;
  blocDescription: string; // Configurable description for the specific BLoC functionality
  rulesPaths: {
    eventRules: string;
    stateRules: string;
    blocRules: string;
    viewRules: string;
  };
}
```

### GenerationStep
```typescript
enum GenerationStep {
  VALIDATE_DIRECTORY = 'validate_directory',
  CREATE_FOLDERS = 'create_folders',
  GENERATE_EVENT = 'generate_event',
  GENERATE_STATE = 'generate_state',
  GENERATE_BLOC = 'generate_bloc',
  GENERATE_VIEW = 'generate_view'
}
```

## Error Handling

The system implements comprehensive error handling at each step:

- **Directory Validation Errors**: Handle cases where feature directory doesn't exist or is inaccessible
- **File Creation Errors**: Handle permission issues and disk space problems
- **Rule Loading Errors**: Handle missing or malformed rule files
- **Template Processing Errors**: Handle syntax errors in templates

Error handling strategy:
- Fail fast: Stop execution immediately when an error occurs
- Detailed logging: Provide specific error messages for debugging
- Rollback capability: Clean up partially created files on failure

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test each component in isolation
- Mock file system operations for reliable testing
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Verify rule application logic

### Integration Testing
- Test complete workflow from start to finish
- Verify folder structure creation
- Validate generated file content
- Test with various bloc names and feature paths

### End-to-End Testing
- Test with real Flutter project structure
- Verify generated code compiles successfully
- Test with existing and non-existing directories
- Validate rule file integration
