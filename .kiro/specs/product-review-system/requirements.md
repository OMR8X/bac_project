# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a Posts feature using Clean Architecture principles. The feature will include domain and data layers with proper separation of concerns, following MVVM architecture patterns. The implementation will use fake data sources without real API calls and focus solely on the backend logic without UI components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement a Posts domain layer, so that I can define the core business logic and entities for post management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the domain layer is created THEN the system SHALL have a Post entity with proper data structure
2. WHEN the domain layer is created THEN the system SHALL have a PostRepository interface defining data access contracts
3. WHEN the domain layer is created THEN the system SHALL have a GetPosts use case that returns a list of Post entities

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement a Posts data layer, so that I can provide concrete implementations for data access and management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the data layer is created THEN the system SHALL have a PostModel class that mirrors the Post entity
2. WHEN the data layer is created THEN the system SHALL have mapper extensions to convert between PostModel and Post entity
3. WHEN the data layer is created THEN the system SHALL have a PostRepositoryImplements that implements the PostRepository interface
4. WHEN the data layer is created THEN the system SHALL have a PostDataSource that provides fake post data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate all layers properly, so that the GetPosts use case can retrieve post data through the repository pattern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all layers are integrated THEN the GetPosts use case SHALL successfully retrieve posts from the data source
2. WHEN all layers are integrated THEN the data SHALL flow properly from data source through repository to use case
3. WHEN all layers are integrated THEN the mapper SHALL correctly convert PostModel objects to Post entities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to follow Clean Architecture folder structure, so that the code is organized and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the folder structure is created THEN the system SHALL have a features/posts directory at the root level
2. WHEN the folder structure is created THEN the domain folder SHALL contain entities, repositories, and use_cases subdirectories
3. WHEN the folder structure is created THEN the data folder SHALL contain models, mappers, repositories, and data_sources subdirectories
4. WHEN the folder structure is created THEN all files SHALL be properly organized according to Clean Architecture principles
